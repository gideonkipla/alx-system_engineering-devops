# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage on November 10, 2023

**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** 
  - Start Time: November 10, 2023, 09:30 AM (UTC)
  - End Time: November 10, 2023, 11:45 AM (UTC)
  
- **Impact:**
  - The web application was completely inaccessible for approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes.
  - Users experienced service downtime, resulting in 78% of users being affected.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the outage was an unexpected increase in database query load, leading to database connection pool exhaustion. This issue was exacerbated by a recent code deployment that unintentionally introduced inefficient database queries.

**Timeline:**

- **09:30 AM (UTC):** Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts, indicating a significant increase in database query latency and a surge in error rates.
  
- **09:45 AM (UTC):** The DevOps team began investigating the issue. Initial assumptions were that the problem might be due to a misconfiguration or a temporary surge in traffic.

- **10:15 AM (UTC):** The investigation uncovered misleading clues suggesting a potential issue with network connectivity. This led to a brief diversion in troubleshooting efforts.

- **10:30 AM (UTC):** As the investigation continued, the team realized that the network was not the problem. Attention was redirected to database performance and connection issues.

- **10:45 AM (UTC):** The incident was escalated to the database administration team to analyze the database server logs for errors or anomalies.

- **11:15 AM (UTC):** The root cause was identified. Inefficient database queries from a recent code deployment had overwhelmed the database server's connection pool, causing the application to slow down and eventually become inaccessible.

- **11:45 AM (UTC):** The issue was resolved by optimizing the database queries, expanding the database connection pool, and rolling back the problematic code deployment.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- **Root Cause:**
  - The primary issue was inefficient database queries from a code deployment that resulted in a sudden increase in database query load.
  
- **Resolution:**
  - To address the issue, the following steps were taken:
    1. Identified and optimized the inefficient queries in the code.
    2. Increased the database connection pool to handle the surge in database connections.
    3. Rolled back the problematic code deployment.
  
**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

To prevent similar incidents in the future and improve overall system reliability, the following actions will be taken:

- **Things to Improve/Fix:**
  - Implement automated performance testing in the deployment pipeline to catch inefficient queries before they reach production.
  - Improve real-time monitoring and alerting for database performance metrics.
  - Enhance the incident response playbook for faster identification and resolution of database-related issues.
  
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Patch the application code to avoid inefficient database queries.
  - Conduct a post-mortem review with the development team to reinforce the importance of code optimization.
  - Implement automated scaling for the database connection pool to handle traffic spikes more gracefully.

This outage served as a valuable learning experience for our team. By addressing the root causes and implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to enhance the reliability and performance of our web stack to better serve our users in the future.
